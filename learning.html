        <em>Lukong</em> was born in <em>Mantum</em> located in <em>Jakiri sub-division</em> in the state of <strong>Bamenda.
        </strong> <Strong>Lukong</Strong> was the <em>3rd child and 2nd son</em> <br>to <em>Lukong Lendzemo and Sikem Bunglam.</em>. 
        His mother, Sikem, came from Nkar while his father came Vekovi. They met at a <br> traditional festival, where the people of
        of <b>NSO</b> meet yearly to display their cultural heritage. After mariage <br> Lukong's parents moved to <b>Mantum.</b>
        This choice was as a result of the numerous farm lands that Lenzemo acquired <br> from his grandparents as inheritance.

        Lunkong Vernyuy's Education and Interest
        </h3>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lukong attended his primary and secondary eduction in <abbr title="Government School">GS</abbr> and <abbr title="Government High School">GHS</abbr> Mantum respectively. He was good in Biology and <br>
        Chemistry but so much interested in Agriculture and Hunting since that was an integral part of his life. He had a dog called <br>
        <b>jumko'o</b> meaning <b>follow and catch</b> in direct translation. His parents say Lukong was very attached to jumko'o and always <br>
        loved having him around. In fact, people say it was difficult to see Lukong without seeing jumko'o around unless during school <br>
        hours. Due to Lukong's interest in Hunting he started training jumko'o how to hunt and took along in the evenings when he went <br>
        hunting. After complementing his secondary school, Lokung did not continue to get his <em></em>advanced level certificate.</em>It was his <br>
        decision to do so because he actually succeed in his secondary school exams with an outstanding performance.</p>

        Lukongs life    
        </h3>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        During Lukong's school days he had a friend called <b>Wiymbiy</b> who came from <b>Tan</b>. They stayed in contact with each other <br>
        even though Wibmbiy decided to further his  eduction to become a <em>medical doctor.</em> Lukong assisted his father to manage the <br> 
        farmlands he owned and also developed his skills in: <br> 
        <!--Creating an unordered list-->
        <ul>
            <p><li>Pastoral farming</li></p>
            <p><li>Hunting</li></p>
            <p><li>Local brewing</li></p>
            <p><li>Trading e.g farm products like yarms, beans etc</li></p>

        </ul>
        His trading business helped to develop a vast connection accross <b>Banso</b> and he started exploiting it as he could travel to other <br>
        parts of the village to buy and sell produce from his fathers farms. Besides he also got customers who use to buy from the livestock <br>
        he kept. He used to travel to <em>Mbve's market in Kumbo</em> regularly since most of his customers settled in that part of the village. <br>
        In Mantum, where he built his house, he opened a small bar at the village square so he could sell <b>rafia and corn wine.</b> Lulong's <br>
        responsibilities gradually became too much for him to handle and his  mother suggested that he should find a woman with whom he <br>
        can build a family with. She will also support him in managing some of the responsibiilities he had like being in charge of the bar. <br>
        Lukong didn't want to accept the new reality that was knocking at his door but after duelling on it for some time he made a decision <br>
        to get himself a companion. Another interesting thing about Lukong is that he assigned numbers to stops at village squares, between <br> 
        Mantum and Kumbo, where vehicles used to break to get other passengers or let some alight. Those stops where in the following order: <br>

        It was during the transition between the rainy and dry season when Lukong started searching for a wife material and fortunately the <br>
        the <b><em>Nso Cultural Festival was around the corner.</em></b>This was a great opportunity for Lukong since the sons and daughters of <br>
        <strong>Ngon Nso</strong> rally during that period to express their cultural prowes. Basically, the two season mentioned already are <br>
        have a relative meaning to the change in weather within a calendar year.<br>
