# learnhtmlandcss 
I followed this youtube tutorial(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) to learn this basics.
The creator of this tutorial has also published the content in his Github page which is accessible via: https://github.com/gitdagray/html_course.
This is the repository i used to learn the basics of html and a few commands in css. In this repository there is a learning.html which i used to 
learn the html tags from the tutorial. The other html are for the small projected suggested by the tutor to practice how to use html to build a website.
